=== IMPORTANT NOTES ON INTERPRETATION ===
Since the LinUCB model is updated using data from both the train and test sets,
the test set performance metrics do not represent the performance of a fixed,
pre-trained model on unseen data. Instead, they reflect the model's performance
while it is still learning and adapting to the test data (online evaluation).
This setup allows us to observe how the bandit algorithm performs and adapts
over time across the entire dataset, comparing performance between an initial
phase (train) and a later phase (test).
